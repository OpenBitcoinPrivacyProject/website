- To organize crowdfunding efforts for developing better tools for Bitcoin privacy, including wallet software and privacy measurement tools

## Members

## Projects

### CoinJoin Sudoku

CoinJoin Sudoku is a tool that measures the privacy afforded by CoinJoin implementations. The first implementation of CoinJoin Sudoku is coinjoinsudoku-php, written by @kristovatlas.

### Open Bitcoin Privacy Library (libbitpriv)

This software will be a framework for blockchain privacy analysis. The framework will be as blockchain-agnostic as possible, allowing developers to easily extend the library to analyze a range of crypto-currencies. This library will be leveraged by future projects that analyze blockchains from a privacy perspective.

## Funding Principles

The goal of the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project is to facilitate the creation of sustainable projects that improve financial privacy in the crypto-currency space. These projects will most often be crowd-funded, and thus must extend the utility of Bitcoin in order to appeal to [speculative philanthropists](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-correct-strategy-of-bitcoin-entrepreneurship/). Crowdfunding can take place through a variety of platforms, including:
- [Tip4Commit](https://tip4commit.com/)
- [Lighthouse](https://github.com/vinumeris/lighthouse)
